    question: 'Is The Offernow a home flipper?',

        <p>
          No, we are not! Home flippers business model is to buy low and sell high, whereas Offernow offers a fair market value and provides a service for a fee. The service we offer is the assurance of an all-cash offer on your home and the ability to move on your own timeline; for a better overall experience, we also drastically simplify the process of the home sale. In the real estate industry, this business model is called the iBuyer.

    question: 'Why selling to the Offernow is better than selling the traditional way?',
    number: 4,
    answer: (
      <div className='faq-question-content'>
        <p>
          With Offernow you do not have to deal with the months of uncertainty, costly preparation and frequent showings that come with the traditional process. We buy your home from you instead of putting it on the market and waiting to find a buyer. What is more, by picking your closing date you can avoid double-moves expenses, double-mortgages, and storage units. The Offernow strives to provide a fair market value for your home and takes a single service fee that allows us to offer a smooth experience from the bid to the closing. Based on our evaluation of how long it would take to sell a home, our fee usually falls within 6-8% but won't exceed 14%. And while we're spending our service fee on maintenance, utilities, and taxes while we’re holding the home, you can move on to what’s next.

      <p>A personal letter can be an advantage and helps convince the seller to accept it. Here are 3 tips to make your offer letter stand out.</p>
      <li>Be yourself. Show your human side: Draw a picture of yourself and your family living in this neighborhood. Let them know how much you want to raise your children and spend your retirement there.</li>
      <li>Describe what you love about the property: By giving a colorful description of the landscape, neighborhood or features of the house, you can ensure that it would stand out.</li>
